The website will have four major areas where most of the activities will be made.

Landing Page:

Discovery Page:
The user will be able to find potential matches, give clicks and check the public profiles.

Profile Settings:
The main page for user settings, here the user will be able to change and update their personal info
as well as checking their match history and purchases.

Store:
Here the user will be able to buy clicks and subscriptions.

Of course, their will be more subpages but these will be the main pages where the user will pass their time.

### User Info

The user will be able to add personal information to their profile, both public and private.
The information added will include:

- Gender
- Age
- Birthday
- Profession
- Interests
- Photos
- Bio

_**Note:** The birthday will always be public, for reasons of reading the zodiac signs and compatabilities._

Information added that is public will be able to be viewed by all, while private info will only be accesible to
the user.

### Store

The store is where we shall implement the buying options
on the website. The user will be able to buy clicks,
either individually or in packs. We also intend to
add a premium service, so the user should be able to
subscribe in one of several plans.

### Discovering possible matches

The information the users will add are viewable
on their discovery card. Here, possible matches will
be able to discover them in the main page. They
should be able to view their photos, bio, and
birthday. Along with any public info they may have.

The user will then be able to then send a match and
await for a response.
