# Carlos' Personal Log

---

This project was rather complicated for me.
The reason being that I hadn't had much experience with backend
and express in general. And due to my teammates having more
experience on React than I had I got saddled with the backend development.

Due to this, I had several problems implementing mongoose and mongo DB, but using the
presentations, youtube videos, and the documentation of the node packages.

### My teammate's contributions

My teammates in no uncertain words created the frontend by themselves.
With their experience with React and Ant Design in particular, they were
able to create forms, views and pages using predefined elements from Ant Design.

Though given that we worked on two different parts of the project, I am not
sure of what each one of them did. Though I do know that they divided components and
views between both of them.

Working with them was more divisive for me given that I felt that I was saddled with
the backend, even when I tried changing posts with someone. But, honestly, I can kinda
understand why they did it. Given their experience with Ant Design and React, I would
have had to study a lot of documentation just to get up to speed.

My contributions were based on the backend, making a router and endpoints to call for the
database, given my inexperience with this I feel that I ended up holding back my team.

This project, in retrospect was good, I feel that we have a good concept and we tried
to use it to its maximum effect. Though I personally feel that the project ended up half-baked.
Given this I would later like to update this with new or more fitting tech, i.e. Hydrogen (Shopify React Framework)
for the e-commerce; probably updating the site as a mobile app.
