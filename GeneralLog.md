- The team came up with the project idea being this a date app based on your zodiac sign and the astral compatibility with other signs.

- The team looked up for astral compatibility charts that would be used for the matches

## 20/11/21:

## 21/11/21:

- Fixed several errors, when using axios post returned error 404, this was due to an error between middleware and router. After that we got an error 500 but given that that was due to errors in js and mongo, debugging was easy.
